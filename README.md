# AI-ML-course  

Machine Learning assignment 
---------------------------
This repo contains my assignment project for the course of Machine Learning, part of the “Msc in AI” held by NCSR “Demokritos” and the University of Piraeus.  The subject of the assignment is an open choice, end-to-end and ‘deep learning free' machine learning project.


The problem 
-----------
I chose to study the Speech Accent Archive found here: https://accent.gmu.edu/ . A collection of over 2200 audio recordings of people reading a common passage.  The goal is to classify the speaker’s native language by their English accent.


Requirements  
------------
numpy: https://numpy.org/install/  
sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html  
librosa: for audio processing and feature extraction, https://librosa.org/  
matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html  
yellowbrick: a fully sklearn compatible library, here mainly used for ease of coding, https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/quickstart.html  

Python 3.8 was used.
